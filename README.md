Introduction/Business Understanding

Traditionally accident prevention has been focused on making the driver more aware of the road conditions given the current weather. I believe that there may be a more effective way for cities to prevent severe accidents. What if a city was able to setup a traffic system that would automatically lower speed limits, extend yellow and red light times, turn on street lights, and reroute traffic around specific roads during inclement weather in real time. When conditions are approaching those which are common during severe accidents specific actions will be taken to lower the risks. For example when the weather is overcast, road conditions are wet on road x the system would lower the speed limit and turn on the street lights to lower the risk of an accident.


Data Understanding


We will only need to look at the variables which are common to the accidents, and not controlled by the driver. So, we will look at the ADDRTYPE, WEATHER, ROADCOND, SEVERITYCODE, and LIGHTCOND. If accidents at intersections are common when it’s overcast, then we would extend the time for the yellow are red light as well as turn on surrounding street lights. If accidents on a section of road are common when it’s overcast and raining, then we would lower the speed limit and turn on the street lights.
